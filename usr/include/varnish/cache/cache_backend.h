 * Backend and APIs
 *
 * A backend ("VBE") is a director which talks HTTP over TCP.
 *
 * As you'll notice the terminology is a bit muddled here, but we try to
 * keep it clean on the user-facing side, where a "director" is always
 * a "pick a backend/director" functionality, and a "backend" is whatever
 * satisfies the actual request in the end.
